          "Delivery will be made by hand via the cargo company at the address specified in Article 3 of the BUYER. Even if the buyer is not at the address at the time of delivery, the SELLER will be deemed to have fulfilled its obligation fully and completely.",

In this case, transportation costs will be borne by the BUYER.",

          "In accordance with the Tax Procedure Law No. 27/1977 and the communiqués and regulations issued under this law, and Chapter 267 Commodity Sales and Chapter 149 Contracts Law, in order to carry out refund transactions, the relevant refund sections on the invoice must be filled in completely and signed and then sent back to the SELLER together with the product.
